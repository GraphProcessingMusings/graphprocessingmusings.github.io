title: About this Blog
---

I have decided to start this blog as concise communication channel to discuss novel research ideas, interesting projects, and research findings that are too small to be published as a separate publication. Mostly, I will write about topics that are somewhat related to my dissertation work around graph traversals in main-memory column stores. However, also other topics related to large-scale graph processing are of particular interest to me. Besides graph processing I'm more broadly interested in data management on modern hardware and challenges that arise from scientific computing and big data.

If you are interested in my work and/or my opinions regarding a special topic, or just want to provide comments, feedback, or criticism please get in touch with me via e-mail. You can find in the _About_ section.
