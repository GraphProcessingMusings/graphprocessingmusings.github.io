My name is Marcus Paradies and I am a fourth-year PhD candidate in Computer Science at the Technische Universit√§t Dresden. 
I am a member of the [Database Systems Group](https://wwwdb.inf.tu-dresden.de/) in Dresden and my 
supervisor is [Wolfgang Lehner](https://wwwdb.inf.tu-dresden.de/team/head/prof-dr-ing-wolfgang-lehner/). 
I work in strong collaboration with SAP SE and the SAP HANA development team, where we have started a 
prototype for graph-centric data management at the core of the SAP HANA database.
